# Contributing to the Project

## Introduction
This document lists the best practices for contributing to the project. Please read through this document before forking the project and making contributions. As this is an assessed University project, only pull requests from ESRS Group members will be considered for merging into the `master` branch.

## Forking the Repo
Whilst all ESRS group members technically have permissions to commit directly to the `master` branch, this is not recommended. Each team member must fork the repo to their own GitHub account. From there, team members are free to make as many commits as they wish. When your features are implemented on your own branch, you must make a pull request to the `master` branch.

## Accessing the Repo on your Local Machine
Once you have forked the repo to your own account, you can access it on your own machine. Open a terminal / command prompt, ensure you have `git` installed, and then do the following:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Group-Project.git`

Making sure you replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.

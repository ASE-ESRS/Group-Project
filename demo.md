# Task 4 Demonstration Notes

1. Demonstrate Task 4. Run the client-side and retrieving results (choose small radius).
2. Demonstrate SE practises:
    - Programmer A makes a change that causes a unit test to fail.
    - Programmer A commits, pushes, and creates a PR for their change.
        - Travis flags that the test no longer passes.
    - Programmer B carries out a code review and identifies the problem, suggests changes.
    - Programmer A corrects their mistake and updates PR.
    - Programmer B reviews again and then merges.
3. Discuss and show the Issues section on GitHub as our way of tracking remaining tasks and bugs.
4. Talk about Pair Programming.
5. Task about (automated) testing with TravisCI.

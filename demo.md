# Task 4 Demonstration Notes

Run the client-side and retrieving results (choose small radius).

## Software Engineering Practises

**Process Demo**
    - Programmer A makes a change that causes a unit test to fail.
    - Programmer A commits, pushes, and creates a PR for their change.
        - Travis flags that the test no longer passes.
    - Programmer B carries out a code review and identifies the problem, suggests changes.
    - Programmer A corrects their mistake and updates PR.
    - Programmer B reviews again and then merges.

**Issue Tracking/To Do**
Discuss and show the Issues section on GitHub as our way of tracking remaining tasks and bugs.

**Pair Programming**
Useful for debugging code. Found that while it did slow us down somewhat, it was very helpful to have a fresh set of eyes on a problem.
5. Talk about (automated) testing with TravisCI.

**Slack**
Channels for the separate modules (e.g. `#server-side`, `#client-side`).

# Project Plan

## Introduction

## Organisation Plan

Nominating a team leader was one of our first objectives. Loic was voted in to oversee the gradual progress of the ASE project. 

Loic shall act as the main source of communication between the team and the customer. If a team member does not understand a task or specification, it is up to Loic to question the customer to pin-point exact information regarding the task and/or specification. Once a task has been completed and sufficently evalated by the team and Loic, the customer will be presented with the finished product through Loic only.

Undoubtedly Loic will be communicating with each member of the team to figure out each of our strengths and weaknesses for the future tasks to come, assigning us each appropriate roles. However, the role of leader does not exlude Loic from assisting the team in different areas; be it documentation, coding or testing, Loic will function as a team-player when needed. Loic will also act as a 'middle-man' between the different team roles; helping us to communicate with each other in an efficient manner. From our prior experience, it is evident communication is vital for all types of group projects where members are appointed different roles with different sub tasks.

In the unlikely case of a dispute between team members, it is the role of the team leader to resolve the dispute and analyze as to why the dispute occured in the first place to ensure similar conflictions do not arise again. Loic should try to be neither bias or partial towards any member of the team, taking neutral ground whenever possible.

If for any reason Loic decides to step down, the team will nominate a team leader promptly to ensure the project is not jeopardized. Equally if the team unanimously decide that Loic isn't performing up to the teams standard, the team have the right to call a re-vote for a new project leader.
